            <h3>How to play CYBER WAR</h3>
            <!-- <p>Each turn, choose a card to bid against the computer for the randomized money in the middle. <br/><br/>
                The SHAPE indicates a card's POWER. The shape with more sides wins the turn. There is one exception: CIRCLE BEATS STAR!<br/>
                If the winning card matches the shape in the middle, a bonus is given equal to the number of sides.<br/><br/>
                The NUMBER OF SHAPES indicates a card's VALUE. The winner of the turn receives the winning card's Value plus the money in the middle. 
                Value breaks ties with Power. <br/><br/>
                The COLOR indicates a card's AURA. Aura breaks ties with Power and Value, with purple the strongest, followed by red, green, and blue. Playing consecutive cards 
                of the same Aura gives a $4 bonus that increases by $4 with each additional card (resets each round).<br/><br/>
                Good luck!
            </p> -->
            <p>Each turn, pick a card to bid for the randomized central pot. 
                The Shape with more sides wins the turn, with one exception: CIRCLE BEATS STAR! Ties in Shape are decided by the higher Number, and further ties are decided 
                by the most valuable Color: purple (best), red, green, and blue. <br/><br/>
                Shape, Number, and Color each have one special scoring rule:<br/><br/>
                SHAPE: If the winning card matches the shape in the middle, a bonus is given equal to the number of sides.<br/><br/>
                NUMBER: The winner of the turn receives a bonus equal to their card's NUMBER.<br/><br/>
                COLOR: Playing consecutive cards of the same Color gives a $4 bonus that increases by $4 with each additional card (resets every round).<br/>
